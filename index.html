        <View style={{flexDirection:'row'}}> <Text style={{flex: 1, flexWrap: 'wrap'}}>It’s that time of year again when all political parties head to conference. For the Conservative Party it was a busy week, where the PM set out his long-term plan for the future, and I spoke about my own vision for education, and how my own journey took me to where I am today. </p>
          Growing up in Liverpool, I have always believed in the power of aspiration and hard work to build a better future for people and their families. Seeing 92% of my classmates leave my comprehensive school in Knowsley with very few qualifications, I know that whilst talent is everywhere, opportunity isn’t. For many young people, a good education is the crucial thing that makes a difference on their journey. For that reason, as the Secretary of State for Education, I am introducing real change in areas including affordable childcare and new apprenticeship routes into many careers for young people, including everything from accountancy to space engineering.</p>
          We’ve made huge progress on these areas already, launching the largest ever expansion of childcare provision in history, more apprenticeship routes than ever and introducing a ban on mobile phones in schools. We will also consult on introducing minimum service levels in universities to ensure students get the lectures they pay for, and their degree marked in time for graduation.</p>

        <p>Back in the constituency, it was a pleasure to visit Brent Lodge Wildlife Hospital, an amazing local charity committed to providing vital treatment and care to a range of wildlife in Chichester and the surrounding area. Whether it’s helping a kestrel mend a broken wing or rehabilitate a hedgehog, all wildlife has an important part to play in Chichester’s vast ecosystem, and the work of the team here is really important to protect that balance.</p>
        If you do find an animal in need of help you can report it to the team, either online or via their advice line at 01243 641 672. You can also support this local charity by making a small donation, volunteering, or giving tins of wet cat and dog food - chicken is a favourite!
